Needed aastex .sty file

did with miktex graphical interface

then got error message "Please update your system to include revtex4-1.cls"

this is outdated package so 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/586368/please-update-your-system-to-include-revtex4-1-cls
and I got off ctan and followed 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2063/how-can-i-manually-install-a-package-on-miktex-windows
and 
https://miktex.org/faq/local-additions

Ie created folder tree matth/localtexmf/tex/latex/revtex4-1
added localtexmf as root in miktex console

downloaded and unzipped revtex4-1 from https://www.ctan.org/pkg/revtex4-1
in cmd ran "tex revtex4-1.dtx"
then copied revtex4-1.cls to matth/localtexmf/tex/latex/revtex4-1 (as don't need full package)

refreshed filename database in miktex console - tasks dropdown menu
 it worked!

Then I got error:
"Class revtex4-1 Warning: No Society specified, using default society aps.


! LaTeX Error: File `aps4-1.rtx' not found."

Unsure why it used aps, but looking at where aastex361.cls uses revtex4-1.cls I think it's right. 
aps4-1.rtx is in revtex package, so I'm guessing it all will be needed, not just revtex4-1.cls
Looking at output from "tex revtex4-1.dtx", files created are 
revtex4-1.cls 
aps4-1.rtx 
apsrmp4-1.rtx 
aps10pt4-1.rtx 
aps11pt4-1.rtx
aps12pt4-1.rtx 
revsymb4-1.sty 

So I'll move these into localtexmf, refreshed filename database, and tried again
It works! no errors/warnings seen (though I didn't look hard)
